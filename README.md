# Capstone: Using LLMs to Solve Business Problems

**TL;DR**: For my Modal.io course *Using LLMs to Solve Business Problems*, I automated a weekly reporting workflow that used to take **30–60 minutes per client** (over a dozen clients) across the agency. Prompt-engineered templates and checks now make the process faster, consistent, and easier to scale.

- **Data note**: All example data is **synthetic/modified**—no real client data included.

## Why it matters
- Standardizes outputs where onshore/offshore feedback and retraining caused inconsistencies.  
- Reduces repetitive manual effort, saving hours each week.  
- Cuts onboarding friction for new hires with a repeatable, documented process.  
- Demonstrates how prompt engineering can deliver business impact quickly.  

## How it works (brief)
1. Define the weekly task + acceptance criteria.
2. Create structured prompts and output formats to match the criteria.
3. Add lightweight evaluations/regex validators to keep outputs on-spec.
4. Package steps so any team can run the same process and get consistent results.
